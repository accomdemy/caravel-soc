# 全端IC設計工程師養成計劃 (FullStack IC Designer Development)
The FullStack IC Designer Development will base on the [Caravel SoC](https://github.com/bol-edu/caravel-soc) backbone. We target two ASIC tapeouts: Google Efabless SKY130 with open source EDA flow ([Openlane](https://github.com/bol-edu/openlane-lab) & [Efabless Caravel](https://github.com/bol-edu/caravel-lab)) and TSMC 0.18um with commercial EDA flow. We also plan to develop a validation system for the chips that come back as verification.
